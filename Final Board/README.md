# Final Board - Capacitive Touch Heart


Okay so my final board ended up being a heart shaped board that has LEDs in the front in the shape of a heart along with a capacitive touch pad in the front. The LEDs are turned on when the capactive touch pad is pressed. I used a SMD ATtiny85 as the microcontroller and had wires soldered to the programming pins originally and just desoldered them after it had been programmed correctly. Here are pictures of the board along with the board design:
