# Final Project - Bill of Materials


Alright so for my final project I am going to be building two connected devices that vibrate when both are "activated". Activation will occur through capactive sensing and the circuit board is going to be built into a fabric. The design is supposed to fit in someones hand so I may end up making the circuit board bigger than it has to be in order shape the eventual device. 

For this I will need (will be checked off as it arives):

- [x] ATtiny85 (have many in the shop already)
- [ ] [RFM69](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sparkfun-electronics/COM-13909/1568-1394-ND/6023504) for communication
- [ ] [Capactvie Touch IC](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/AT42QT1010-TSHR/AT42QT1010-TSHRCT-ND/2268871)
- [ ] [Vibaration motor driver](https://www.newark.com/maxim-integrated-products/max1749euk-t/motor-driver-vibrator-120ma-sot/dp/73Y2629?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvI3jspnl4QIVw5CfCh0Q1w9oEAQYAiABEgKHWPD_BwE&gross_price=true&mckv=sMunMqCAG_dc|pcrid|81515568381|plid||kword||match||slid||product|73Y2629|pgrid|20376568821|ptaid|pla-148798651461|&CAWELAID=120185550002986234&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=20376568821&CMP=KNC-GUSA-GEN-SHOPPING-Semiconductors_Ics&CATCI=pla-148798651461) (Do i need this?)
