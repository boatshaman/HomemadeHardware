# Final Project - Bill of Materials


Alright so for my final project I am going to be building two connected devices that vibrate when both are "activated". Activation will occur through capactive sensing and the circuit board is going to be built into a fabric. The design is supposed to fit in someones hand so I may end up making the circuit board bigger than it has to be in order shape the eventual device. 

For this I will need (will be checked off as it arives):

- [ ] [ATtiny84](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/ATTINY84A-SSUR/ATTINY84A-SSURCT-ND/2774136) (will mill a breakout board for prototyping)
- [ ] [RFM69](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/sparkfun-electronics/COM-13909/1568-1394-ND/6023504) for communication
- [ ] [Capactvie Touch IC](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/AT42QT1010-TSHR/AT42QT1010-TSHRCT-ND/2268871)
- [X] transistor for vibrator
- [ ] [Vibaration Motor](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/adafruit-industries-llc/1201/1528-1177-ND/5353637)
- [ ] [Small Lipo Batteries](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2750)
