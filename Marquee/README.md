# Marquee Letter - O


This week we all were tasked with making a single letter in a Marquee sign. I was assigned the letter "O" and I attached a photoresistor onto the board to add an input element.

The hard part about this is we needed to make it completely from scratch. Design the schematic and circuit board on Eagle ([marquee.sch](pics/marquee.sch) and [marquee.brd](pics/marquee.brd) respectively), drill the board using Bantam and the Othermill PCB milling machines, add solder paste and SMD components by hand, solder additional parts on, and finally code an ATtiny 85 and stick it into the board. 

As my first time creating a circuit board from scratch I would say it went decently well. Here is the schematic:
