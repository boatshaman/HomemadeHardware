# ATtiny85 First Interaction

Our first assignment was to make a simple interactive system with the ATtiny85 acting as our microcontroller instead of, say, the Arduino Uno. 

This allows us to make our own interactive devices without the need to include a full comercial microcontroller and instead just make our own. 

I used the programming rig that we created to upload simple arduino code which turned an LED on with the touch of a button.

Here is a video of the simple interaction:
